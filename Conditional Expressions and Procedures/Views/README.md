## Views

Often there are specific combinations of tables and conditions that are used quite often in a project. Views can be used to quickly perform those queries with a simple call.

- Example syntax from VIEW statement

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
