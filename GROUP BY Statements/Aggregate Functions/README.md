## Aggregate Functions

Main idea behind an aggregate function is to take multiple inputs and return a single output.

Most common aggregate functions:

- AVG(): returns average value
- COUNT(): returns number of values
- MAX(): returns maximum value
- MIN(): returns minimum value
- SUM(): returns the sum of all values

Aggregate function calls happen only in the SELECT clause or the HAVING clause.
